description_declare_variables = """Pss... We came up with an interesting idea for business here.There are many things in
the world that consist of a few words. We can create a make_abbr superprogram that will return abbreviations for them.
Nobody has ever done that before! Will you help us? You are in destiny.
As soon as it starts to bring us profits, we will transfer the funds to you. Exactly. Wow. Let's live!
You can expect the name to consist exclusively of letters and the words to be separated by a space.
Examples:
    make_abbr ('national aeronautics space administration') == 'NASA'
    make_abbr ('central processing unit') == 'CPU'
    make_abbr ('simplified molecular input line entry specification') == 'SMILES'"""
