description_declare_variables = """Write the parity_checker function, which uses the input function to read the number
and output the string "Even" if the number is even, and the string "Odd" if the number is odd.
Be sure to pass the message "What number do you want to check?" To the input function so that the user understands what
information you need to enter.
Hint: the input function always returns a string.
For example, if the user enters the number 4, the input will return the string "4".
Use the int function to convert a string to a number.
Example:
    age = int (input ("How old are you?"))
    # User enters "21"
    print (type (age)) # "class 'int'>" is displayed on the screen"""
