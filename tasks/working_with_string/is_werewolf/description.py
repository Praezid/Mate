description_declare_variables = """We have received information that werewolves can be dangerous to humans.
We don't know yet why, but we can't ignore this information. We need to start detecting werewolves as soon as possible.
We suggest to take words and sentences for the purpose. They will not run away in any case. As we have understood,
among words and sentences werewolves are words that are read in both directions equally and ignore spaces and punctuation.
Please write the is_werewolf function, which gets the target string and returns True if it is a werewolf.
Note: target can contain Latin letters (both uppercase and lowercase), spaces and punctuation.
Examples:
    is_werewolf ('rotator') == True # rotator -> rotator
    is_werewolf ('home') == False # home -> emoh
    is_werewolf ('racecar') == True
    is_werewolf '' red rum sir is murder ' ) == True
    is_werewolf ('eva, can I see bees in a cave') == True"""
