The tax rate depends on the amount of your income:
    up to UAH 1,000 inclusive - 2% tax;
    from UAH 1,000 to UAH 10,000 inclusive - 3% tax;
    anything over UAH 10,000 - 5% tax;
Write a Calculate_taxes function that takes the entire amount of income (your income) and returns the data you pay."""
