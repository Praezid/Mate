that will perform basic mathematical operations between `a` and `b`:
    -variable `addition` must add `a` and `b`;
    -variable `subtraction` must subtract `b` from `a`;
    -variable `division` must divide `a` by `b`, use integer division;
    -variable `multiplication` must multiply `a` by `b`;
    Note: don`t change the values of variables `a` and `b` and don`t delete them!"""
