description_declare_variables = """The code contains variables `a` and `b`.
Your task is to declare new variables that will perform the following mathematical operations between `a` and `b`:
    -the variable exp must raise `a` to the power of `b`;
    -the variable mod must find the remainder of dividing `a` by `b`;
Note: do not change the values of variables `a` and `b` and do not delete them!
Tip: Use the `**` and `%` operators to perform the required calculations."""
