description_declare_variables = """The host decided to slightly change the rules of previous entertainment.
The newlyweds choose the number of steps, and now the toast is not spoken by every guest,
but only the first and every next, which comes through the selected number of guests.
For example:
    -if step = 1, then, as before, the toast is spoken by each guest;
    -if step = 2, then 1st, 3rd, 5th ...;
    -if step = 3, then 1, 4, 7, 10 ...;
Write the function get_drinks_with_step, which takes number_of_guests and step and returns the number of cells, which
must be prepared for the competition. As before, we suggest using the for loop, but with a range of two parameters."""
