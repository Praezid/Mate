description_declare_variables = """Let's help the toastmaster to calculate how many portions of booze you need to prepare, and write the function get_drinks.
It takes an integer number_of_guests and returns the required number of drinks to be enough for all guests.
For example, if number_of_guests = 3, you will need:
    -1 serving when the first guest arrives;
    -2 more when the second one comes;
    -and 3 more when the third comes.
Total 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 servings.
We suggest using the for loop and when the next guest arrives, just add what you drank now to what you drank before."""
